This was the final project that included aspects from all of the previous projects in the course.
I used sounds that I recorded while walking around the streets of Florence, Italy and scenes that
I drew using tiles I created in paint.NET.
My goal was to convey the constant presence of sound regardless of your location in the city. The
different sounds can transport you to different areas if you listen closely, but you can never 
really reach true silence. The user has some control of their sound and their environment, but 
certain sounds are always there and can create a harmonious ambience or a harsh disruption.

Clicking objects such as the door or construction site can trigger new sounds, and it is possible
to travel between two different areas by clicking around to move.
