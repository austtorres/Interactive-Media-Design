I was tasked to create a program that displays a simple crest that represents my identity. 

The cart represents my connection to traveling, while the wine inside is a homage to my
new passion for wine that I found while in italy. The blooming flower indicates that I
went through a lot of growth by traveling and experiencing a brand new culture.
