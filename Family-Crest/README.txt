Austin Torres Florence Crest

This crest represents myself and my connection to Florence, Italy
The wagon represents the markets that I visit daily for food, drinks
clothes, and other goods. The wine is present because wine is a huge
part of the culture in Florence. It is much more prevalent than in
the United States, and I have developed a strong appreciation for
wine since arriving in Florence. 

One of the reasons I love Florence so much is because of its history
during the Renaissance. I have been learning about this in my art
history class, so I have included some elements from this era.

The frame is gold leaf which was popular for many of the paintings 
made by renowned artists that I
have been studying in my art history class. The red canvas is meant
to simulate the vermillion color common in paintings in the Renaissance
because of its availability. The flower is a common association with
Florence and the Renaissance because of its connection to spring and
rebirth. It is growing to further emphasize this point. The yellow
and red colors are very common from what I have experienced here which
is why I chose that as my color palette.
